data_exploration_dashboard comments:

The data can be explored here in a few different ways. First, we can change the Health board and have our graphs change to only be data from that health board. For example, in data_exploration_dashboard_1, we've looked at Ayrshire and Arran, while in data_exploration_dashboard_2 we've looked at Fife. This allows us to look at each health board individually and see the Covid demographics change accordingly. 

We can also look at different categories. For example, data_exploration_dashboard_3, we've changed tab from 'Covid Impacts - Demographics' and are looking at 'A&E' graphs. In this screenshot, we've selected the Health board of Fife to get their A&E stats.s
